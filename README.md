Some projects and analyzes made in  Google Colab environment

capacity manager project - context: Capacity refers to the amount of orders (or items) that a groceries store can deliver in a given period of time, considering factors such as its operational efficiency, late orders, etc. The intelligent manager uses artificial neural networks to suggest the ideal capacity considering historical and real-time indicators for the store

Expl SLA stores - context: For a groceries store to start selling in an online app, there is a process called "deployment" , which refers to the journey from the first contact with the store until it manages to place its first order. The main indicator that measures the efficiency of this process is the Deployment SLA (mesured in days). This simple exploration was made to verify that current SLA targets were consistent with the area's historical results. (Real project, generic ilustrative data)
